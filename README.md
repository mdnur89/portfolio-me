# Personal Portfolio Site

## Description

A personal portfolio website built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/), and [Emotion](http://emotion.sh). Transpiling, bundling, and build processing done with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

## Styling with Emotion

I absolutely love [Emotion](http://emotion.sh).

## Details

The site is fairly clean and simple on a single page. There's no permanent navbar, but
an expandable nav menu provides smooth scrolling to corresponding section
of the website.

Sections:

- Hero Image Home and Title
- Contact Info and Resume
- About Me Summary
- Sample Projects: a selection of projects with links to live deployments
  as well as to Github for further details and information.
